# Installation

## Setting up environment 

Get poetry following this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

You should ensure that you have Python 3.9 to run the code correctly. Other versions might work, but they are not tested. Poetry will enforce the correct python version and will create a local virtual environment for you with everything installed. Of course, you can run everything as well without poetry, but in this case you are on your own.

## Cloning and installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aloysiogl/conforme.git
```

Change directory to the repository and, within it, install the dependencies with `poetry install`.
